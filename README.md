In many online learning platforms, a significant challenge lies in converting user registrations into meaningful engagement. One notable example is the gap between users who sign up and those who complete essential onboarding steps, such as an admissions exam. This drop-off represents a missed opportunity for both users and platforms, potentially affecting learning outcomes and user retention.

This project addresses the problem of low admissions exam completion rates by investigating whether behavioral nudges, in the form of reminder emails, can improve user follow-through. Using synthetic data, we will conduct a controlled A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of reminder interventions.

To make the analysis accessible and actionable, we will develop an interactive web application using Plotly Dash. The app will enable stakeholders to visualize key metrics, explore A/B test results, and understand the impact of reminders on user behavior. By combining experimental analysis with a user-friendly interface, this project delivers insights that can guide data-driven strategies for enhancing user engagement in digital education platforms.
